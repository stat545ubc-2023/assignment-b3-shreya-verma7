**Interested in Data Exploration and Analysis of BC Liquor Dataset? Check out my app [here](https://shreyaverma.shinyapps.io/DataAnalysis_BCL_Updated/)**

### Description
This app provides basic data exploration and analysis for the BC Liquor dataset. The user can filter the dataset using custom selection on price range and drink type(s). The app also displays the filtered dataset. To enhance the value provided to the user the app increases data exploration functionality and user experience through the addition of functional and UI features.

Some of the Key Features added: 

Assignment 3

- **App layout**  
  Increased UI through navigation tabs for housing similar types of information per app page and a clearer user understanding, as well as an app theme for improved visual appeal. 
- **Computing results for user filters**  
  Total product items based on the combination of user filters are calculated and displayed - directly increasing the data analysis functionality by returning a concise answer to a query over a large dataset.  
- **Improving information and layout**  
  Plot for another data attribute is added; allows multi-dimension data exploration, and is displayed via a 'tabs' layout for an aesthetic and appropriate representation scheme i.e. related information is placed closely.
  
Assignment 4

- **Displaying an image**  
  Including relevant image(s) enhances the visual appeal thereby increasing user interface experience.  
- **Instant data access**  
  Adds functionality by allowing users to download the filtered data as a .csv file. Filtered option was chosen since it is more flexible - includes downloading the original data via no filters as well.
- **Interactive data table**  
  Added interactive table - enhancing the functionality. Users can conveniently sort columns as well as perform custom searches via the input box.
 
**Bonus: Multiple-input box over radio buttons!**
